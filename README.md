# A Novel Implementation of Machine Learning for the Efficient, Explainable Diagnosis of COVID-19 from Chest CT Images
 
Motivated after witnessing the ravaging effects of COVID-19, I decided to tackle the novel coronavirus by engineering an open-source solution to **assist the healthcare industry**. Consequently, my most recent project focused on creating **rapid, reliable COVID-19 machine learning-based diagnostics**. Through leveraging transfer learning, Grad-CAM explainability, and a diverse dataset with sources from The Cancer Imaging Archive, a Chinese consortium, and a Kaggle dataset, **I attained 96% sensitivity and 90% precision.** The manuscript regarding the project was **accepted into the peer-reviewed [International Journal of High School Research](https://ijhighschoolresearch.org/)**. The **[full text of the paper](https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR305448)** has also been **hosted on [Europe PubMed Central](https://europepmc.org/)** as part of a **COVID-19 initiative** supported by a joint award from **Wellcome, UK Medical Research Council, Swiss National Science Foundation**, and endorsed by the **Chief Scientist of the World Health Organization (WHO)**.
